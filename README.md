# Pix2pix Demo on Pokemon

This is a Keras demo of Image-to-Image Translation, mentioned in the [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1611.07004.pdf). 


I trained the models on a dataset with 1800+ Pokemon images, and its original version can be found [here](https://github.com/phillipi/pix2pix)


You can find its Torch implementation in [this repo](), and another Keras version is in [this repo](https://github.com/williamFalcon/pix2pix-keras).

### Dependencies

- Python version: 3.6.4
- Keras version: 2.2.4
- Tensoflow version: 1.11.0
